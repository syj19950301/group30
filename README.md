Generate a machine learning model that can predict the success of a Playlist (the number of end followers), using data corresponding to the Playlistâ€™s length, genre, and component tracks. The goal is to use this model to generate a successful Playlist according to a user-specified genre like Indie, Rock, Classical, and so on.
